// Hey React, come on. I would need this as a global value in a global state. But I could not figure out, how to do
// this easily. The public documentation does not go into details, StackOverflow and Medium aren't that helpful (it 
// seems nobody really knows how to do it) and using a third party lib is a bit out of scope.
// I'm really amazed how React can be that successful.
export class Style {
    static readonly color: string = "white";
    static readonly backgroundColor: string = "#1884ae";
